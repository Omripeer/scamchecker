🌟 Project Purpose
The internet can be a dangerous place, with many fraudulent websites trying to trick people into giving away personal information. This tool was created to provide a quick and easy first line of defense. Users can paste a suspicious URL, and the app will check it against Google's extensive database of unsafe websites, providing a clear, color-coded answer about its safety.
The project is designed with accessibility in mind, featuring large text, high-contrast colors, and a simple, single-purpose interface.
